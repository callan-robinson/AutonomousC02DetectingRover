<summary><h4>Project Discription</h4></summary>
The Autonomous CO<sub>2</sub> Detecting Rover is a robot built and fine-tuned using microcontrollers as the control system and the Robot Operating System (ROS) to control different sensors, including LIDAR for navigation and PID for regulating speed and turning rate with 98% precision. The Rover Integrates a real-time heat map of air quality data on a human-machine interface (HMI) using temperature, humidity, and CO<sub>2</sub> sensors onboard the robot, achieving a 95% accuracy in mapping determined through linear regression analysis.
